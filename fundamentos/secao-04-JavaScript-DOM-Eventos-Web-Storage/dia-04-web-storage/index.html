      <p class="paragraph"> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
        page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
        distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
        Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
        search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
        the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph"> The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
        interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in
        their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. </p>
      <p class="paragraph"> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
        ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
        aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu
        fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit

      <p class="paragraph"> "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising
        pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
        great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
        itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
        consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
        pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can
        procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
        exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to
        enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
        pleasure?"
